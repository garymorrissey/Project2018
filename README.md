# The Iris Flower Data Set

The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information which was compiled by [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher), a British statistician and biologist, in the 1930's. Anders Hald states in his 'A History of Mathematical Statistics' that: 

> much of Fishers work single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science. 

This work stems from his collaboration with [Edgar Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Anderson), an American botanist, and the compilation of a set of data which aims to demonstrate statistical methods of classification. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species or Iris flower - Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Veriscolor. Four specific features were measured from each sample;

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
